So a quick update about a couple of things that happened to me in the last months, without order...
- Got married to Sandra (yehaa!) 🤵👰
- Left Pix4D, the start-up I co-founded, after 7 years and over hundred employees
- Jumped the 3rd tallest bungy jump
- Trained for a full marathon 🏃‍♂️
- Sailed again on the lac léman ⛵
- Went to an executive product class at INSEAD and many more conferences
- Built a satellite ground station to communicate with the ISS 🛰️
- Decided with Sandra to live a nomadic life the next 3-4 years. We give up our flat in Lausanne, and we stay at some places for 2-5 months before moving on. First destination: Lisbon in January! 🌍
- Followed an intense coaching training, and started a coaching practice!
