Making products is awesome. Products can impact users at a huge scale, but they are also incredibly hard to get right. Especially when many people need to work together to build them.

Here are a couple of pointers that would have helped me when I started to get more serious about products! Notice I don't make the difference between owner or manager, as I mostly agree with Pinchler's [blog post](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-manager-vs-product-owner/&sa=D&ust=1542052208644000).

Start by watching the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D502ILHjX9EE&sa=D&ust=1542052208644000) PO in a Nutshell by Knibert. It mostly describe the functioning of a healthy agile environment, but it also provides a nice view on the tactical side of the product ownership. And it allowed to explain to my relatives much  to explain myself!

In addition to the PO role, there are also a lot of more strategic considerations to take in account. A good overview of them are in the PM handbook by Intercom (to [download](https://www.intercom.com/books/product-management&sa=D&ust=1542052208645000)from their website). Then I would suggest next the "[User Story Mapping](https://www.amazon.com/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product-ebook-dp-B00NF07FHS/dp/B00NF07FHS/ref%3Dmt_kindle?_encoding%3DUTF8%26me%3D%26qid%3D&sa=D&ust=1542052208645000)" book by Jeff Patton that not only introduce some tools, but mostly talks of the importance to use stories as a communication medium. To me this book is a huge reference that I keep going back to. Subscribing to Martin Pinchler's [blog](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/&sa=D&ust=1542052208645000)is also a good idea, and reading his [book](https://www.romanpichler.com/romans-books/strategize/&sa=D&ust=1542052208646000)is a must.

Ok, so now you see that tactical and strategic side of Product, let's look at it from 3 other perspectives:

* Business: First let's start with what innovation is ([innovator's dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244&sa=D&ust=1542052208646000)), and how to gain knowledge ([lean startup](http://theleanstartup.com/book&sa=D&ust=1542052208646000)). An understanding of business models is a necessity, and that includes concepts such as the canvas ([business model generation](https://strategyzer.com/books/business-model-generation&sa=D&ust=1542052208647000)) to some more classics ([4P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix&sa=D&ust=1542052208647000), [swot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis&sa=D&ust=1542052208647000), ...). Just as important to understand how [sales](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Business-Business-Sales-Marketing/dp/0071408797&sa=D&ust=1542052208647000)work, and of course where in the life cycle you are ([crossing the chasm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC119W/ref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect?_encoding%3DUTF8%26btkr%3D1&sa=D&ust=1542052208647000)).
* Customer: Very related to UX, some great pointers are "[don't make me think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758&sa=D&ust=1542052208648000)", ["the design of everyday things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded-ebook/dp/B00E257T6C/ref%3Ddp_kinw_strp_1&sa=D&ust=1542052208648000)" for an older, longer and more theoretical intro to UX. In addition I love the "[Lean UX](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Designing-Great-Products-ebook/dp/B01LYGQ6CH/ref%3Dsr_1_1?s%3Ddigital-text%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1542043519%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3Dlean%2Bux&sa=D&ust=1542052208648000)" from Jeff Gothelf
* Technology: the [Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Y98RG8/ref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect?_encoding%3DUTF8%26btkr%3D1&sa=D&ust=1542052208649000) is a good intro to lean software dev and DevOps. The spotify culture [videos](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/&sa=D&ust=1542052208649000) (also from Knibert) are also good, as well as Martin Fowler [blog](https://martinfowler.com/&sa=D&ust=1542052208649000)and Uncle Bob's [blog](https://blog.cleancoder.com/&sa=D&ust=1542052208650000).

I would recommend to immediately join on [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/&sa=D&ust=1542052208650000)local groups that include words like Product, Agile or Scrum, UX and Lean. As conferences, [the Product Management Festival](https://productmanagementfestival.com/&sa=D&ust=1542052208650000) in Zurich is awesome for the strategic part of Product Management. [Agile/Lean Europe](https://agilelean.eu/&sa=D&ust=1542052208650000) is great too, mostly focused on tactical lean and agile concerns, and Business Agility in NY opens the eye to a larger picture on the challenges of larger organization to move to a more agile & product oriented way of working.

Finally, it is good to remember that product management is a leadership position. And leadership is also a competence that needs training and awareness. A big part of it is to perform self-development. Books or videos about [vulnerability](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language%3Den&sa=D&ust=1542052208651000)and emotional awareness were a good start for me. As well as understanding of [teams](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756&sa=D&ust=1542052208651000). But I would suggest that the most important is to get followed by a professional coach. The idea is not to get any advice or tips (that would be a mentor), but someone acting as a mirror to help introspect as well as asking tough questions. To me, training as a coach myself was an invaluable source of self-development as well as leadership competences
