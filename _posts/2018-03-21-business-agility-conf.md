# Business Agility Conference NY 2018

A 3-day agility focused conference with lots of great speakers. Here are my personal 
highlights:

## Yin and Yang of speed and Control by Jon Smart (Barcleys)
Very good talk of someone who truly understands agility, and who has tried, failed and succeeded.
Instead of trying to scale agility (which he argues doesn’t work well), he points out to first focus on descaling the work, and reducing cycle length. Agility is not the goal, it is more a consequence when the organization is focused on the outcomes (which can be further refined as Flow, Quality, Happiness, Value). A lot about breaking silos to focus on the value streams. Helping leaders moving away from command & control.

Providing a lots of transparency in the work, especially the link of the CEO’s top5 priority, and how the work done by anyone relates to that. He did a planning wall that shows this connection, weekly newsletter to keep up to date on the progress, as well as a “lean control tool” to advertise progress and allows expert feedback.

## Founder’s Mentality by John Allen (Bain&Company)
Amazing talk by John Allen. He theorizes what he calls “founder’s mentality”: a winning combo of front-line obsession, owner mindset and insurgency. When growing ( and “growth creates complexity, and complexity is the silent killer of growth”), the company is pushed by two negative forces. 
The first one is composed of
1. The unscalable founder
2. Lost voices from the frontline
3. Erosion of accountability
4. Revenue grows faster than talent
The second one, that usually happen at a later stage of growth is made of
1. Complexity doom loop
2. Curse of the Matrix
3. Fragmentation of Customer Experience
4. Death of the nobler mission

The trick is to fight these two forces to become what he calls “scale insurgent”. There is then the concept of micro-battles: very short cycle iteration prove-me-wrong prototyping. However he also talks about how to transition these prototypes to larger scale in order to capture the benefits of size. He sees 3 communities: the agile one that owns and drive innovation, the scaling one that scale winning innovations across the org, and the execution community that executes core repeatable processes and provide expertise.


Fascinating, and I got a book signed by him to go further!

## Company-wide agility with beyond budgeting, open space, sociocracy
Not really a talk, mostly promotion for a book with the same title, but probably a good intro to sociocracy. 

## Give employee a voice: (Retrium)
A nice argument that retrospective can be a good practice to empower a team… but only if the team can indeed share the outcomes and get feedback about them. A concept of a “retrospective radiator” is presented, made of columns “learnings”, “talk to us if …”, “hypothesis and exp”, “Action Items”, “Impediments”. The team can transparently advertise this board, but then the leadership team has the responsibility to look at it at every retro to provide feedback and hopefully remove impediments.

## BUURTZORG : keep it small, keep it simple
The amazing tale of Buurtzorg, a dutch company that removed wasteful management practices from healthcare and instead replace it by a well supported self-organized concept. A better explanation is available at https://www.buurtzorg.com/about-us/buurtzorgmodel/
When talking with Ard, I could get a further key insights: they didn’t come to the self-organizing model from the the start, but by experimentation. One of the key driver to success was also a razor sharp focus on solving a single problem and not trying to jump on every opportunities. He had a very good point: backoffice will always justify themselves, yet do not deliver value and increase complexity. To remove it, he had a concept of a Minimal Viable Back Office. A note for managers: don’t manage: serve, guide and cut complexit. Finally, it was interesting to get his opinion that he would be sure if it would have worked if it wasn’t a non-profit company.


## Mission, vision, values
A story that helps aligning on the true goal of the organization. Should fit in a hand: one vision and 5 core strategic pillars. Should be embedded in every aspect of the company: admin documents, hiring questions, evaluations, … It is the leader’s responsibility that everyone in the org knows it and lives through it.

## Interview Games
If you do a lot of “games” in your everyday work, why not embed them into your interview practices? Games offer a space for improved interaction and engagement. They try to stimulate collaborative work, enable transparency and encourage feedback.

## Sky betting
How the practices of a software team changed the way HR is working. Embedding HR people (“People ops”) inside of the tribes, and following agile methodologies (scrum, short iterations, transparency). One of the most effective action they took was to decouple financial reward from performance management. In addition they removed objective setting, fixed semi-annual bonus payment, shared success stories, provided ,ore autonomy on learning&dev, and established retrospectives.
I love it when HR is not only there to defend the legal side but also tries to improve (or at least not to hinder) work in the company.

## The secret Sauce (Marsha Z Shenk)
A culture of trust is the most important. The formula of trust is:
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Vulnerability) / self orientation(confidence)
Signs of vulnerability : I was wrong, I don’t know, I’m sorry, That idea is better than mine

## LeadershipTransformation (Corelink)
Very inspiring story by great leaders. Added a huge amount of transparency by making physical dashboards from team to leadership levels. Insisted on culture (probably to restore trust) by taking actions on it. Identify and remove toxic leaders. Many references to Flow
