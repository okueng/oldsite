Easter time! And now, time for some egg painting automation…
What about drawing patterns on your computer, and have a printer drawing them with a pen on an egg.

1. Sourcing from Aliexpress the different parts
2. Print from the parts from thingiverse using my Lulzbot Taz6
3. Solder the parts on a protoboard
4. Install the necessary inkscape plugins
5. Fix the python files for my setup
6. Get some vectorial files from google
7. Let’s print!
