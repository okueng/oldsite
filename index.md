<img style="float: center;" src="/assets/img/coaching_big.jpg"/>

Are you facing an important decision? Do you feel a need to clarify the balance between your values and your choices? Or simply reflect on a change in your journey through life?  

**Coaching supports and empowers you** to make **decisions** and choose the **best path** for your **professional** and **personal** journey.

# About me
<img style="float: center;" src="/assets/img/olivier_big.jpg"/>

My name is Olivier and I am from Lausanne in the french speaking part of Switzerland. Through my entrepreneurship and leadership journey, I have been always supported by coaches that helped me to go beyond my doubts and my beliefs. 

After growing for 7 years my succesful software start-up with over 100 employees, I wanted to find a way to give back and offer this support to others. To provide the highest standard of coaching, I followed the [IDC professional coaching training](http://www.idc-coaching.com/) and I am on my way for its certification. 

# In practice

**How long does coaching take?**
  
Coaching is a process that is usually done through 1 hour sessions, with around 5 to 12 sessions at a two week interval depending on the need and objectives. 

**Is it possible to do it remotely?**

The sessions can be done by phone, skype or in person, either in french or english as I am bilingual.

**Do I need a clear objective to start?**

You can come either with a clear objective, or just with a vague feeling about something unbalanced or blocking, in which case we will work to refine it as an objective. The subject can be personal or professional, as they are usually interleaved. 

**How confidential is coaching?**

The sessions are bound to strict confidentiality rules. See section 4 of the [ICF ethic code](https://coachfederation.org/code-of-ethics).

**How much does it cost?**

My current rates before the certification are at 30CHF/session and will be a 150CHF/session after, as normal swiss market rate.

**How do I contact you?**

Simply drop me a mail, sms, whatsapp, details are at the bottom of that page.

## Mentoring
Coaching empowers, but do not provide advices from my personal experience and expertise. There is nothing I enjoy more than passionated discussions and mentoring around entrepreneurship, product management, business models, management, UX and tech. Let's have a talk!
